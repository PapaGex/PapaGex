- 👋 Hi, I’m @PapaGex
- 👀 I’m interested in deep learning, algorythmic trading, blockchain technology and ethical hacking. I also love breeding geckos and other reptiles as well as writing independent punk noise rock folk music.
- 🌱 My prefered way to communicate with metal is Python and Javascript, Rust Julia and C++ get out of the garage a bit as well. I learned BASIC in the 80s and started C++ in 1991.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I am interested in and have the time for
